You will need to install rethinkdb and create a database to match the settings in this app before getting started.

You can follow the guides to install rethinkdb at (RethinkDB install)[https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/]

Once you have rethinkdb installed and running, create a database name 'plant_monitoring_system' and a table name 'measurements'.

Now you are ready to install and run the app.

To run the app open up another terminal and type `npm install && npm start`.

Open any modern browser and go to `localhost:3000`
